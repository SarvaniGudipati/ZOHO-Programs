# ZOHO-Program

In this project,
I created folder ball_bricks which contains Ball and Brick project.
Each question is an individual c program namely Q1.c to Q5.c

Q1.c contains code for taking matrix size and positions then printing game matrix.

Q2.c contains code of Q1 along with code for traversing input and output.

Q3.c contains code for breaking down of numerical bricks when the balls hits. 

Q4.c contains code for types of demolishing bricks and
